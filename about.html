      <p>Welcome to my page!
      
      </p>

      <p>My name is Jennifer and I currently live in Belleville,NJ. To be able to know a little bit more about myself I have to talk about my background and that will explain why I want to succeed in any career path I can</p>

      <p> I was born in Georgia but family decided to move back to our homecountry Ecuador, where I lived there until the age of 14. Turning 14 and realizing that I can have a better future here I decided to tell my parents to move in this Country
        In a new fresh country I came to live with a family friend. Having no family and knowing no one in this new world made me want to have more. I was succeesful to graduate from Montclair State University with a bachelors of Arts but I was not done.
        I had always been interested on programing since I was in high school but never dared to look more into in. Thats when I found Rutgers coding bootcamp which I want to finish and become a Full Stack Developer. Coming from another
        country and realizing that I can do so much makes me conquer anything that is on my life.
