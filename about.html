      <p>My name is Jennifer!</p>
      I currently live in Belleville, NJ. 
      <p>A little story about myself.

       I was born in Georgia but family decided to move back to our homecountry Ecuador, where I lived there until the age of 14. Turning 14 and realizing that I can have a better future in the land where all 
       dreams can become true made me  decided to tell my parents to move here.  I graduate from Montclair State University with a bachelors of Arts but I was not done.
        I had always been interested on programing since I was in high school but never dared to look more into in. Thats when I found Rutgers 
        coding bootcamp which it will help be to  become a Full Stack Developer.
